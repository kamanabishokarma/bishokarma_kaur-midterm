            <h2>Why cats is better than dog</h2>
            <p>Cats:

                Low Maintenance: Cats are known for their self-sufficiency. They clean themselves, use a litter box, and require minimal grooming.
                
                Independent: Cats don't need constant attention and can be left alone for longer periods, making them a great choice for people with busy schedules.
                
                Quiet and Clean: Cats are generally quiet animals, and they are less likely to disturb neighbors. They are also meticulous about cleanliness and grooming, reducing the need for baths.
                
                Space-Efficient: Cats are well-suited for small living spaces, such as apartments, and they don't need a yard to run around in.
                
                Pest Control: Many cats have strong hunting instincts and can help keep your home free of unwanted pests like mice and insects.

            <p>I am partially agree with Kamana`s point of view<br>
                
                Dogs:
                
               According to me dogs are more popular than cats and they are more faithul than cats.  <br>

             Loyal Companionship: Dogs are known for their unwavering loyaltyand strong emotional bonds with their owners. They become an integral part of the family.<br>

            <h2>Why dog is better than cat</h2>
            <p>I agree that dog is better than cat because dogs are more trainable, use the bathroom outside, can protect you, and promote a more active lifestyle. Having a dog has many benefits that make it better than having a cat. And it is posssible to think one is better than the other but I still love both.

            <h2>Aruging AGAINST</h2>
            <p>I disagree Noor,s opinion because of course,Cats require less maintenance than dogs. 
                They self- clean, do not need walks nor to be taken outside to go to the toilet. 
                Cat's do not need any formal training and are capable of entertaining themselves. Most kittens will know instinctively how to use the litter box as soon as you bring them home.
