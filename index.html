            <h2>Why cats is better than dog</h2>
            <p>Cats:

                Low Maintenance: Cats are known for their self-sufficiency. They clean themselves, use a litter box, and require minimal grooming.
                
                Independent: Cats don't need constant attention and can be left alone for longer periods, making them a great choice for people with busy schedules.
                
                Quiet and Clean: Cats are generally quiet animals, and they are less likely to disturb neighbors. They are also meticulous about cleanliness and grooming, reducing the need for baths.
                
                Space-Efficient: Cats are well-suited for small living spaces, such as apartments, and they don't need a yard to run around in.
                
                Pest Control: Many cats have strong hunting instincts and can help keep your home free of unwanted pests like mice and insects.

            <p>I am partially agree with Kamana`s point of view<br>
                
                Dogs:
                
               According to me dogs are more popular than cats and they are more faithul than cats.  <br>

            <h2>Why dog is better than cat</h2>
            <p>I agree that dog is better than cat because dogs are more trainable, use the bathroom outside, can protect you, and promote a more active lifestyle. Having a dog has many benefits that make it better than having a cat. And it is posssible to think one is better than the other but I still love both.

            <h2>Aruging AGAINST</h2>
            <p>I disagree Kirkâ€™s opinion because of course, winter brings people together because they need to keep them warm, not for reason of love or connection of each other, but everyone can feel heat from summer weather and there<br> 
                \are lots of people share love and make connection in summer. People can relax on the couch with hot coco and cover in blanket, but it only happens inside of home, but people can have more activities such as go outside<br>
                 and travel anywhere in summer which is warm and hot session. People need an aircon and fans, but they also need heater for winter, so there is no different that people need electro products to pass these two sessions. <br>
                 People is struggle to sleep in summer because of heat, but winter gives coldness to people in sleep and it irritates them as heat.
